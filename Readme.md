# Exercises 42* rank 2

In order to enable you to check the code I have included its corresponding mains.

If the exercise is a function you will find its coresponding main in the source-folder of its level.
It will have to be compiled seperately (with its corresponding prototype).

 __Example compilation level_1:   
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror swap_main.c ft_swap/ft_swap.c__

This can avoid some mistakes as you are making sure the function does work propery.  

Also, never push these mains if you are in examen.

In case of a program, the main is obviously included in the file.

When compiling, never forget to use the flags (you may have some small mistakes which the flags would pick up on).

I **strongly recomend** you to write your own mains and do different testings as well.    
If you are in examen you will need to be able to write your own mains in order to check your code.. you can also use the lldb (if you are working with Mac) but only if you are having a working main.

Do not just copy the code.. understand it, search for other solutions on the web and develop your own solution.

To see whether the your codes are working, you can run the through the grademe programm which is fairly close to the **real thing** and can help you to train for the examen.
